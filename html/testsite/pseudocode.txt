ANIM CONTROLLER PSEUDOCODE
(SUPERSWEEPER, STATE MACHINE)
(total guesswork)

SUPER SWEEPER (js)
1. pass it an initial folder to sweep. in this case testsite/assets/birdbook
2. create total page arrays
	2A. array includes everything starting with testsite/assets/birdbook/page_01... and so on
3. create anim arrays
	3A. sweep down to frame level. testsite/assets/birdbook/page_01_panel_00_frame_00 and so on
	3B. if a frame_01 is found, create an array to include everything that pairs (page_01_panel_00_frame_XX) (?)

(do i need to automatically create vars for what's swept?)
(can i include arrays in arrays?)

now there should be arrays like

total_page_00 [page_00_panel_00_frame_00, page_00_panel_01_frame_00, page_00_panel_02_anim]	(?)	(or...)
total_page_01 [page_01_panel_00_frame_00, page_01_panel_01_frame_00, page_01_panel_01_frame_01, etc]

page_00_panel_02_anim [page_00_panel_02_frame_00, page_00_panel_02_frame_01, page_00_panel_02_frame_02, etc]
page_01_panel_01_anim [page_01_panel_01_frame_00, page_01_panel_01_frame_01, etc]
page_01_panel_02_anim [page_01_panel_02_frame_00, page_01_panel_02_frame_01, etc]

4. animStruct {constructor(img_id, frames, update_freq)}
5. manually (?) create vars for each img_id in the html
6. anim arrays should be paired to vars with frame arrays respective to ids
7. further pairings of frequency ints respective to ids

8. anim vars to create instances of animStruct
9. setInterval to updateAnim (linear frame animator) using each animStruct and their respective update frequency


STATE MACHINE(js)
1. probably do the former step 8 but differently
	1A. anim vars with SPECIAL ANIMSTRUCT or animStruct with SPECIAL VARIABLES
	1B. setInterval using whatever the fuck that'll be, probably in a SPECIAL UPDATEANIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2.
