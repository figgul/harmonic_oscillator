ANIMATION STATE-BASED CONTROLLER

** NOTE: CHANGE ALL REFERENCES TO NAMING CONVENTION WITH "_reference" **
** NOTE: COMMENT CODE SUFFICIENTLY!! **
** NOTE: RENAME NEXTSTATE!! **

1. data.js
	1.1. manually define all in-document img_id
	1.2. manually define all frames
	1.3. define arrays for sets of frames
	1.4. define correlating animState IDs
	1.5. (make all data static)

2. link data.js to animcontroller.js

3. nextState	(class)
	3.1. calls constructor requiring animState ID and a weight
	3.2. generate instances of nextState

4. exitProtocol	(array)
	4.1. define multiple exitProtocol arrays for each animState
	4.2. exitProtocol are populated with nextStates
	
5. animState	(class)
	5.1. calls constructor requiring animState ID, frame set array, exitProtocol

6. animStruct	(class)
	6.1. calls constructor requiring in-document img_ID and initial animState (sets current_state)
	6.2. set current_frame to 0

7. stateMachine	(class)
	7.1. create function for determining new states
	7.2. pass in animStruct
	7.3. chooses a new state based on exitProtocol and Math.random()
	7.4. after choosing a new state, update current_state for animStruct
	
8. updateAnim	(function)
	8.1. pass in animStruct
	8.2. uses current_state to update current frames
	8.3. when current_state finishes, ask stateMachine for a new current_state
